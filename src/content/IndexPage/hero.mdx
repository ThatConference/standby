description: After 15 incredible years of bringing together thousands of geeks, fostering community, and inspiring the next generation of technologists across the Midwest, we're taking a pause to reimagine THAT Conference. Since 2010, you've helped us prove that investing in Midwest tech was worth it—through 16 events, over 2000 sessions, and countless connections that extended far beyond those four days each year. While we won't be hosting THAT Conference, this isn't goodbye—it's a chance to evolve. The perfect storm of post-pandemic challenges means we need to step back, regroup, and design a sustainable path forward that stays true to our mission of inspiring, creating, and supporting our community. We're committed to finding new ways to bring people together, because we believe community matters now more than ever. Read Clark's full letter to the community.
